# changelog

## unreleased
- provenance made precise: the crypto/wire-format core is clean-room; the
  RAOP/AP2 transport in `raop_sender.cpp` is credited as a C++ port of pyatv
  (MIT). pyatv's MIT notice now ships in `licenses/THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.txt`.
- added `## security` scope note (sender does not yet authenticate the receiver;
  trusted-LAN use), plus `SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md` (with the clean-room
  rule), an issue template, and a CI build of the crypto core.
- hardening: bplist UTF-16 length DoS-bound; pair-verify empty-shared-secret
  guard. ed25519 build now matches its SOURCE.md (drops seed.c / `ED25519_NO_SEED`).
- initial extraction from FXChainPlayer: the verified AirPlay 2 realtime sender
  + the Qt-free crypto/wire-format core.
- README carries the complete seven-step AP2 realtime recipe + the
  pair-verify-vs-transient audio-key story (the macOS 32-byte clamp).
- Apache-2.0 (explicit patent grant for the reverse-engineered protocol); vendored ed25519 (zlib); Mbed TLS (Apache-2.0) at build time.
- trademark / non-affiliation disclaimer added to README + NOTICE (Apple Inc.
  marks used nominatively; clean-room interoperability client, ships no apple
  keys/certs/firmware).
